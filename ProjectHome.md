# Collection of common-use Android widgets #

This project is intended as a repository for common Android widgets that may be of use to other developers.  Less emphasis will be placed on creating robust re-usable drop-in libraries but rather sample source code that can be used as-is for basic purposes or easily customized for your own purposes.

## HorizontalPager ##

Intended as a ViewGroup that mimics the UIScrollView horizontal paging functionality of iOS.

Supports:
  * Each child inherits the width and height of the HorizonalPager.
  * Swipe to page left and right, or invoke `scrollLeft()` and `scrollRight()` methods to accomplish the same.
  * OnScrollListener will report scroll and scroll-finished events (use to implement a "current page number/position" view, for example).

Much of the code for this class was adapted from the Workspace class from the official Launcher app (AOSP).
